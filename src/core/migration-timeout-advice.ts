/**
 * #7108: what to tell the user about a recorded migration timeout
 * (migration-timeout.ts), as one sentence and the fix. apply-migrations
 * (`migrations_pending`, reason `still_behind`) and doctor `schema_version`
 * both use it.
 *
 * A lock wait stops at the schema lock timeout (`schema_lock_blocked`) long
 * before the 10-minute budget, so a timeout means the migration's own work took
 * that long. Three cases:
 * - The run had no prelude for the migration and this release has one: rerun.
 * - Idle-in-transaction sessions were open: they may hold locks the work
 *   waited on row by row. They were sampled once and may be gone or unrelated,
 *   so the user checks them with doctor --locks, and only after agreeing ends
 *   the ones still open, then reruns.
 * - None were seen: a plain rerun fails the same way, so once the user agrees,
 *   one run with a longer budget (its table locks are held that long).
