/**
 * `gbrain repair uncommitted-deletions --source <id>` (#7130): restore soft-deleted pages whose recorded file Git never
 * held (`.gitignore` excludes it, or no commit holds it and it is not on the disk), which a managed sync deleted before
 * #7130 because it read the absent file as a deletion. Such a tombstone may hold the only copy of its page, and the
 * purge removes it for good after its retention window.
 *
 * Explicit-only, preview-bound and consented: the preview (`scanUncommittedDeletions`, on the source's canonical owner
 * host only, `not_owner_host` elsewhere) lists each page with its slug, recorded path, deletion time, evidence and who
 * deleted it, binds the set to the owner it ran under and saves it under its hash; the default set is the pages a sync
 * deleted, and `--include-ambiguous` adds the ones another writer deleted. `--apply --expect <hash> --yes` restores
 * exactly that set, one coordinated `restore_page` with `detach: true` per page, published database-only: the page
 * comes back live, forgets its recorded file (`database_only_reason='detached'`, `detached-pages.ts`) and no file is
 * written, so the next sync has no file to read as missing and never deletes it again. A page that changed since the
 * preview is skipped `changed_since_preview`; one whose file is back in the checkout is skipped `file_restored` (sync
 * reads it); one purged in between is skipped `purged`. Pages already purged cannot be restored by this command; only
 * a backup can bring them back. One preview reads one bounded window of tombstones (descending page id); a truncated
 * preview prints `next_after`, and `--after <page id>` previews the next window (the hash covers it). Never runs on upgrade
 * or from a maintenance cycle.
