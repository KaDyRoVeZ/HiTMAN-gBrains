/**
 * #7130: a managed sync deletion is a machine's inference that a file is gone, not a person's decision, so its
 * tombstone must not turn into a hard delete without review. Each `managed_sync_delete` apply records the tombstone it
 * made, in the same transaction: one `op_checkpoints` row per page (op `sync-delete-tombstone`, fingerprint = the page
 * id), `completed_keys[0]` holding the record. A record is open while its page is still soft-deleted at the recorded
 * `deleted_at`; a restore, a purge or a later delete of the restored page closes it, and only then may the checkpoint
 * sweep (purgeStaleCheckpoints) drop it.
 *
 * The automatic purges (the cycle purge phase and the `purge` job) leave such a tombstone alone unless another live
 * page of its source holds the same content (a live twin); the consented `gbrain pages purge-deleted` purges it and
 * says how many of its set these are. A tombstone made before records existed is recognized by its uncompacted
 * committed `managed_sync_delete` receipt; once that receipt is compacted it is no longer recognized.
