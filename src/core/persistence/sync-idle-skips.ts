/**
 * GBRA-133 (PR 2b): the managed no-op fast path. An idle tick (sync-pass-run.ts `stampIdlePass`, the pass kind
 * `syncPassKind` decides) stamps `last_sync_at` and the pass row under the drain lease and changes nothing else, yet the
 * managed branch still ran every settle after it: each one reads the state it would act on, finds nothing and returns.
 * The pin already reads most of that state, so the tick records here what it read, and each settle below is skipped when
 * the fact it acts on is absent. The tick itself, its lease, its pass row and its result are unchanged, and every settle
 * that can still find work on an idle tick (the upstream observation, the remember replay, the ghost-page report) runs.
 *
 * `GBRAIN_SYNC_IDLE_FAST_PATH=0` runs every settle again.
