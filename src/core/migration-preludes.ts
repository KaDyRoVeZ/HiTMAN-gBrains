/**
 * #7108: runner-side preludes for published schema migrations whose SQL
 * rewrites a large table in one transaction.
 *
 * A published migration file never changes: brains that applied it never run
 * it again, so an edit would land only on some brains, and release restamp
 * refuses one. A migration's SQL runs in a single transaction under the
 * runner's statement budget (10 minutes), so a backfill that updates every row
 * of a large table can time out on every attempt and roll back, leaving the
 * brain below that migration for good (#7108: v221 on 1.7 million chunks
 * without a vector).
 *
 * A prelude does that migration's row writes first, right before the runner
 * applies the migration on a brain that has not applied it yet, in id-ordered
 * batches of a bounded size, each its own committed transaction with its own
 * statement budget. Progress is the data itself: a batch writes only rows the
 * migration's own predicate still selects, so an interrupted run resumes and
 * never rewrites a row it already wrote. The migration's SQL then runs
 * unchanged and finds nothing the prelude could write, and it still covers rows
 * another process wrote after the last batch. A prelude adds a column the migration
 * would add first, in the migration's own column order, so fresh and upgraded
 * brains keep the same column ordinals.
 *
 * Only a backfill whose predicate excludes the rows it already wrote can be
 * moved here; docs/guides/troubleshooting.md#migration-statement-timeout lists
 * the migrations that cannot and the operator budget for them.
