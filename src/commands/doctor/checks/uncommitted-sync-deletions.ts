/**
 * #7130 `uncommitted_sync_deletions`: soft-deleted pages a managed sync removed although Git never held their recorded
 * file (`.gitignore` excludes it, or no commit holds it and it is not on the disk), one reader in
 * `src/core/uncommitted-deletions.ts`. Before #7130 sync read such an absent file as a deletion, so the tombstone may hold
 * the only copy of the page and the purge removes it for good after its retention window. The finding names the
 * read-only `gbrain repair uncommitted-deletions --source <id>` preview; restoring is the user's decision.
 *
 * Read-only and bounded: at most `DOCTOR_PATH_LIMIT` tombstones read and checked per run across sources (descending page
 * id), with `truncated` / `exact` details; a bounded source names the `next_after` page id, and the message names the
 * repair preview that continues from it (`--after`). Pages deleted by another writer are counted apart
 * and never warn. Off the owner host, on a brain without managed sync or with no bound source it is `ok` + info
 * (`not_applicable`); a checkout or Git history that cannot be read is the unknown convention (`warn`, `health: unknown`).
